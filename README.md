# Devera

### Project Prototype
Deploy-Link : https://dev-era.vercel.app/


Devera is a platform designed to help students and developers solve a common problem: finding a team for a project. The prototype of this application allows users to sign up, join teams, create projects, and manage their work collaboratively.

The goal of Devera is to be a comprehensive platform for students to:
* Find a team with a specific tech stack.
* Work on projects together in an organized manner.
* Showcase their real-life coding skills to recruiters.

## 🚀 Key Features (Prototype)

* **Team Creation & Joining**: Users can create a new team for a specific project or join an existing one based on their interests and tech stack.
* **Project Management**: A timeline-based system allows team owners to assign tasks, set deadlines, and manage project progress.
* **User Profiles**: Users can create a profile to showcase their real-life code, projects, and skills, similar to a digital resume.
* **Role Management**: Team owners have the ability to define and assign specific roles to team members within a project.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**:
    * **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## 🚧 Current Status

This repository contains the frontend prototype of the Devera application.
* The user interface is functional and interactive.
* Core features like team creation and project management timelines have been designed and implemented.
* The application is currently running without a backend. All data is mock or placeholder.

## 🔧 Future Development

The primary focus for future development is the backend. This includes:
* Setting up a database to store user, team, and project data.
* Building APIs to handle authentication, data retrieval, and real-time updates.
* Implementing a secure login and signup system.
* Developing the full-fledged project management functionality.
